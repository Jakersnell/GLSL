# GLSL
A collection of  GLSL shaders I have written.
## What is a Shader?
A GPU Shader is a special type of program crafted specifically to run via the GPU. The advantage of running a program on the GPU is that unlike the CPU, the GPU excels at high-throughput parallel processing. In non-fancy words, this means programs run on the GPU can run massive amounts of computations that run at the same time. This is a perfect process for intensive mathematical operations that are needed in fields like computer graphics and scientific simulation.  Shaders are also just fun because they make you think much more low level, and allow you to utilize the power of the gpu to make really cool visuals.
